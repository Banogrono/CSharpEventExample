# CSharpEventExample
This is a simple demonstration of events in C#. This program makes use of C# events in
following way: 

Class Point has fields X and Y which help position the point in space. 
To illustrate how position of the point is changed, a simple map is drawn. 
Pressing up, down, right or left arrows on keyboard results in point movement
in corresponding direction. This is achieved by invoking the event, when value 
of X or Y is altered. Thus the map is redrawn only when X or Y is changed.   

## Features

- Can move a point
